# Scriptarium

**Scriptarium** is my personal collection of scripts focused on **system administration** and the **automation of repetitive tasks**.  

Here youâ€™ll find utilities written in different languages â€” **Bash, PowerShell, Python, among others** â€” with the aim to:  
- Optimize system administration tasks.  
- Reduce manual processes prone to human error.  
- Centralize useful tools in a single repository.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
The repository is organized into folders by language, for example:

- `bash/` â†’ Scripts for Linux/Unix.  
- `powershell/` â†’ Scripts for Windows environments.  
- `python/` â†’ Cross-platform tools and advanced administration utilities.  

---

## ðŸš€ Purpose
This repository is not meant to be a framework or a full suite, but rather a **practical lab of SysAdmin solutions** that will evolve over time.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Status
Constantly evolving: new scripts will be added and improved as new needs arise in my day-to-day system administration work.
