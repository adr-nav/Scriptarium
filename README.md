# Scriptarium

**Scriptarium** is my personal collection of scripts focused on **system administration** and the **automation of repetitive tasks**.  

Here you’ll find utilities written in different languages — **Bash, PowerShell, Python, among others** — with the aim to:  
- Optimize system administration tasks.  
- Reduce manual processes prone to human error.  
- Centralize useful tools in a single repository.  

---

## 📂 Structure
The repository is organized into folders by language, for example:

- `bash/` → Scripts for Linux/Unix.  
- `powershell/` → Scripts for Windows environments.  
- `python/` → Cross-platform tools and advanced administration utilities.  

---

## 🚀 Purpose
This repository is not meant to be a framework or a full suite, but rather a **practical lab of SysAdmin solutions** that will evolve over time.  

---

## 📌 Status
Constantly evolving: new scripts will be added and improved as new needs arise in my day-to-day system administration work.
